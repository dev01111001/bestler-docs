# Transfer Flow

## Statistic Details

This shows cross-chain-transfers initiated, regardless of when the incoming transaction effectively happens on the destination chain.

## Functions

Hovering the ring will show all arrows of outgoing and incoming transfers on that chain.

Hovering arrows will show outgoing transfers of that chain only. A tooltip including the transfer count gets shown.
