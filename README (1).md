# Transfers and Transactions

## Statistic Details

### Transfer Count

Cross-chain transfers got an outgoing transaction on the source chain and an incoming transaction on the destination chain. Only successful outgoing transactions are counted towards this statistic. In other words: This shows the number of successful cross-chain token transfers initiated from the chain selected.

On-chain transfers are sending assets onto the same chain. Those are handled in a single transaction.
